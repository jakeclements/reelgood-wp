In the Widgets admin page, drag the "Social Media Icons" to the sidebar. Expand the settings and choose a theme (Default is initially selected). Save the widget to switch themes. Click each icon to enter the corresponding URL or setting. Check/uncheck the plural form / new window options.  Once you have finished configuring the widget, save the widget settings.

= How do I add my own icons to the widget? =

Disable the plugin. Using an FTP client, navigate to the "iconset: folder under the wp-content/plugins/smc_widget/images in your wordpress installation.  Create a new folder for your custom iconset, naming it accordingly.  Add your icons (.png format, preferably 32px x 32px size). Reactivate the plugin.  The new iconset will appear in the themes selection in the widget settings.
